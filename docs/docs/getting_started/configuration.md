**CommandChain** requires OpenAI API key to run. You can acquire it by registering an account [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and setup via environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `openai_api_key` parameter in `OpenAi` class. Because the API key is sensitive information, we recommend you to setup via environment variable.

To setup via environment variable, run:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```
