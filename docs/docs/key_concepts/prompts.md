A Prompt is like a question or command we give to a language model. Sometimes, we need to adjust these prompts to get the best results. In CommandChain, we use a method similar to Microsoft's guidance language for this.

Guidance is a handy tool that helps us manage advanced language models better. It's more effective than the old ways of prompting or chaining methods. With guidance programs, we can mix and match different processes, like creating new content, giving prompts, and controlling logic in one smooth flow. 

Here are some features it offers:

- It's easy to use, thanks to its simple syntax inspired by Handlebars templates.
- It can produce complex outputs with multiple generations, selections, conditions, and more.
